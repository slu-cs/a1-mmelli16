Late penalty: Two weeks late due to a combination of factors. I'll only penalize for two days.

Overall comments on grading questions:

1. Does your site make the information easy to find?
  - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
  - I can't find how to email the BoE.
  - I have to dig to find the dates of the elections in 2020.
  - I have to dig to find the deadlines for registration/absentee in 2020.
  - I have to scroll to the bottom of pages to find links to important forms.

2. Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
  - For the most part, yes.
  - The page title (in the browser tab) is Bootstrap Grid System.
  - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
  - Office hours seem like they could be better represented in a table.

3. Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
  - For the most part, yes.
  - Text in the main seems a little crowded against the header.
  - Some lists in the Voter Registration and Absentee Voting pages are written as paragraphs.
